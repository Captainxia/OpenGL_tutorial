new era, new shenzhen

to leave or to stay?

we all heard the story that about two score years ago, 
our great leader Deng xiaoping brought forth upon 
the side of South China Sea a new city, shenzhen, 
concieved in liberty and open enconomy, and dedicated to 
the great proposition that china's openess to the world
would bring a new and better life to all of us.  
And now it is time to say Shenzhen has not let him down,
and will never fail his faith. 

However, back to about 15 years ago, there were some rumors on the
Internet, which boasted some dark predictions that shenzhen was going down since
it had lost its policy advantages over its rival cities. Definitely, 
those so-called predictions all have been doomed by technology trends.
It is those new high tech companies that have developed so fast during the past decade
as to successfully pushed shenzhen back to the future.
